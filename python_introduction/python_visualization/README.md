# Basic Concepts

## What is numerical weather prediction?
According to the [Glossary of Meteorology](https://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Numerical_forecasting), _numerical forecasting_ is defined as
~~~
(Also called mathematical forecasting, dynamical forecasting, physical forecasting, numerical weather prediction.) The integration of the governing equations of hydrodynamics by numerical methods subject to specified initial conditions.

Numerical approximations are fundamental to almost all dynamical weather prediction schemes since the complexity and nonlinearity of the hydrodynamic equations do not allow exact solutions of the continuous equations.
See numerical integration, numerical simulation.

## What is reanalysis?
According to the [Glossary of Meteorology](https://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Reanalysis), _reanalysis_ is defined as 

~~~  
Same as analysis, except for two important practical differences.

First, it is not done in real time, and second, the background field is made by an NWP model that does not change over the entire period of the reanalysis. A serious problem with climate change studies made from standard analyses results from frequent changes in the model used to generate the background field. These changes (including changes in resolution and orography) lead to discontinuities in a time series of real-time analyses. A reanalysis yields complete, global gridded data that are as temporally homogeneous as possible. Reanalysis data include many derived fields (heating, soil moisture over land, etc.) for which direct observations are nearly absent.

## What is climate prediction?
According to the [Glossary of Meteorology](https://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Climate_prediction), _climate prediction_ is defined as 

~~~  
The prediction of various aspects of the climate of a region during some future period of time.

Climate predictions are generally in the form of probabilities of anomalies of climate variables (e.g., temperature, precipitation), with lead times up to several seasons (
see climate anomaly). The term "climate projection" rather than "climate prediction" is now commonly used for longer- range predictions that have a higher degree of uncertainty and a lesser degree of specificity. For example, this term is often used for "predictions" of climate change that depend on uncertain consequences of anthropogenic influences such as land use and the burning of fossil fuels.
